# my_resume_app

This project is a flutter resume app which contains personal details and also various social media links of mine. It also has portrait and landscape modes and a toggle button that enables user switch between dark and light modes.

It is a single-page applications which has its page structured like a simple resume.
It contains links to various social media profiles which users will be directed to on tap.
it also has a dark theme mode and a toggle switch to change between dark and light mode.
The UI and app design is a very simple one.

The code base used for the application id Dart. It is an object-oriented language. It uses static type checking to ensure variable values always match their types. It is also a flexible language allowing the use of dynamic types.

## Libraries used

URL launcher: This is a package that allows you to add plugins in applications. I used this to link my various social media pages to their respective handles that were contained in the application.

Get Storage: It is a storage library which was used in the application to store the bool values of my theme mode for the purpose of toggling the themes without issues.

Font Awesome: A library which contains various beautiful icons which a few of them were used in my application.

Get: A flutter state management package.


I would have loved to add a language picker function to the application so users can have the option to pick various languages of their liking.

There were really no challenges faced in building the app.
